## Permanent refugee camps

Only a handful of countries welcome international climate refugees, and most are corralled into permanent refugee camps. It’s a humanitarian disaster.

Leaders in rich countries grow increasingly nationalistic, arguing that refugees must be kept out at all costs. They warn that refugees will bring disease and crime into their countries, and that it’s their own country’s problems that created this whole mess to begin with.

Eco-fascism is an ideology that blames environmental breakdown on marginalized communities, arguing that overpopulation, over-industrialization, and immigration is causing climate change. Followers often believe that racial purity and anti-multiculturalism are solutions to the climate crisis. Many eco-fascists can be characterized as white supremacists.
