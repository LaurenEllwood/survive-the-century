## Ecological technocrats


The world launches a global climate fund: a taxation pool that taxes those who produce pollution or consume luxury goods, and uses this money to fund these projects to rewild and protect the environment.

Global South countries band together and argue that they shouldnâ€™t have to contribute to this pool, and also that old IMF loans should be forgiven, because of the historical debt of colonialism.

**Should rich countries agree to this?**

[[That seems fair.->Global climate fund]]

[[Absolutely not!->Later Global South strike]]
