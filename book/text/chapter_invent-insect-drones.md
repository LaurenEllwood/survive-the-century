## Invent insect drones


The council manages to release pollinating drones and new heat-resistant crops that don’t need to be pollinated, so most people are saved. But there’s still a year of food rationing, which made people pretty miserable.

The Council manages to restabilize the climate, though, once again proving that it is the greatest and humanity can withstand anything.

The weather in most parts of the world is still unreliable. The Council says that this proves that nature can’t be trusted, and our best hope is to separate ourselves from it as much as possible.

Our Council invests more money in creating safe climate-controlled cities that are resilient to extreme weather. Some communities start to experiment with building cities that are entirely underground, or are covered with huge domes to protect them from the outside world.
