## Global climate fund


The world agrees! And decides that the global climate fund can also be used to support any projects that increase GHW (global human welfare) anywhere in the world.

Global inequality plunges to the lowest level it’s ever been. People are generally well fed, well educated, happy and healthy. There’s not a lot of luxury consumption, but people are able to spend time building strong, healthy relationships with each other.

We’re really starting to see the benefits of having restored wild space. Animal populations are recovering, and the world temperature has started to drop slightly. Scientists say we’ve turned the corner.

It’s not over yet, though. Coastal communities are still being hit by extreme weather events and flooding.

[[Woohoo! You made it to 2060.->Welcome to 2060 (Ecotopia)]]
