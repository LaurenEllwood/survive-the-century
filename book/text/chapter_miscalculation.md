## Miscalculation


Uh oh.

You get a frantic phone call in the middle of the night: a rogue group has hacked the fleet of space mirrors, bringing it offline.

Your lead climate reporter tells you, in a voice choked with fear, that a sudden increase in the temperature could be catastrophic. Our only hope is that all the way back in the 2050s when we launched the space mirrors, we continued to clean up all the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere too.

[[Oh heck, did we do that?->Carbon capture?]]
