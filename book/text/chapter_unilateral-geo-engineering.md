## Unilateral geo-engineering

A global agreement seems impossible. Years of drought and crop failures lead Barron Trump, America’s newly appointed Leader-for-Life, to erect a huge vertical pipe spraying sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere (yes, there are a lot of dick jokes).

This cools America but causes drought across India and southern Africa.
