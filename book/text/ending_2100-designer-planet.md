# So, where do we end up by the end of the century?

We are rich and flourishing, living on a high-tech, fully engineered planet that would be unrecognisable to people of today. We live in the constant fear that if one piece in this complex system fails, that might be the end of humanity.

# How did you get here?

You focused on adapting to climate change rather than trying to stop it. You got lucky, and your technological fixes mostly worked.
