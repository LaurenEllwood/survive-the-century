We deploy high-tech carbon capture technologies (literally giant machines that clear the air and ocean of pollutants), and they’re a real help in stabilizing the climate.
{:.leader-sentence}

These machines are expensive, though. Activists point out that one way we could fund them would be to disband our militaries. The world has been a very peaceful place for decades, after all!

Should we disband our militaries?
{:.choice-question}

- [Yes! Let’s get rid of all the militaries.](chapter_disband-the-militaries.html){:js-var="js-var-military-no"}
- [Hmm… maybe let’s keep some kind of planetary defence system in place, just in case.](chapter_disband-the-militaries.html){:js-var="js-var-military-yes"}
{:.choice-options}

Carbon capture technologies aim to clean the air by filtering pollution out and storing it, usually underground.
