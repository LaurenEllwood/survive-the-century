## Who looks after the wild?

There’s all this new wild space in different parts of the world. Species are recovering. It’s beautiful and valuable. People would love to get their hands on it. We could use this for tourism! Or let rich people live there! Or exploit newly discovered resources! Corporations also want to fund (and manage) them because they’re carbon sinks, to offset their activity elsewhere.

**What should we do with all this lovely wild space?**
{:.choice-question}

[[Fund indigenous communities and small co-operatives to keep running them.->Local communities]]

[[Let rich people build private paradises there.->Corporate forests]]

[[Set up central committees of ecological specialists responsible for managing the wild.->Ecological technocrats]]
