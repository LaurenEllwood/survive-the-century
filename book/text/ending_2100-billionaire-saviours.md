# So, where do we end up by the end of the century?

We mostly avoided the worst effects of climate change, but we completely lost any hope for democracy or fairness. Unfettered disaster capitalism created a blindingly unequal world, where the rich are mostly insulated from climate impacts and thereâ€™s a huge, suffering underclass.

Better hope they never rebel.

# How did you get here?

You allowed capitalists to run rampant and did not ever address inequality.
