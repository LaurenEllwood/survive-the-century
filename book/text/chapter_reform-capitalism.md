## Reform capitalism

We tax the rich and invest in public infrastructure and generous grant programmes.

Freed from constant worry about their next pay cheque, we start to see a lot of experiments in new forms of communal and sustainable urban living.

We start reforming capitalism with new rules like employee representation on boards. The gap between rich and poor closes.

A lot of carbon capture projects happen on a grassroots level as co-operatives and community-owned projects. It looks like the world is on track to reach zero emissions by 2037.

**But wait, the rich have \#sadfeels about all this! They produce charts proving that all this equality will decimate the worldâ€™s economy!**

[[Oh no! Better undo all of these reforms. Things were fine before, werenâ€™t they?->Gains reversed]]
