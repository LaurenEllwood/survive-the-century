## Fracking-funded UBI


We realize that there’s one clear way we could fund UBI projects: fracking. We can consider natural gas a transitional energy source that helps to wean us off dirtier technologies.

Your paper, as an influential voice, supports this. Right now, it’s more important that we build a more equal economy than worry about pollution.
