## Small-scale wars


Climate rebels around the world start implementing small-scale projects to hack the climate. These projects somewhat work, but have unintended consequences. Communities have to adapt to a lot of sudden weather changes: areas that had a lot of rainfall suddenly have to cope with droughts; cities that had become more resilient against droughts suddenly have to deal with flooding.

The world erupts in a series of violent local conflicts over suddenly scarce resources. You publish a report saying that three quarters of the people in the world now live in a country experiencing civil war.

The effects are terrible. Millions starve. Billions are displaced by war. This decade is called “the terrible 70s”.
