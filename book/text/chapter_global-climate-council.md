## Global climate council

We successfully launch a fleet of space mirrors that controls how sunlight is reflected from the planet.

In a historic meeting, we establish a new global climate council that oversees the project, and begin to deploy it.

The council is warned that if the space mirror project ever fails, there might be terrible consequences. They can also invest in a backup plan, building machines that suck carbon out of the atmosphere, but it will be expensive. The cost will mean a five per cent reduction of everyone’s UBI, which will be unpopular!

**Should we also invest in the planetary clean-up project?**
