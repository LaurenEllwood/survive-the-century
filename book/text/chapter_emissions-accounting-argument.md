At the climate summit, leaders need to agree to stricter emission-reduction targets. 
{:.leader-sentence}

[There’s a debate](#infobox) about whether historical emissions should be counted towards a country’s total target (which would damage the economies of currently rich countries) or whether only current emissions matter (which would impact China and other emerging economies).

How hard should we push rich countries to pay for climate change?

> Although the whole world suffers because of climate change, some countries are far more responsible for it than others. The US alone has caused 25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of historical emissions. Some believe that historically high-emitting countries should be entitled to a smaller portion of the remaining carbon budget and should compensate low-emitting countries for the damage they’ve caused.
