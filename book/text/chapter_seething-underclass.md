## Seething underclass


Our attempts to hack the climate start to work, and create gorgeous, liveable micro-paradise zones in parts of the planet.

You have to be very rich to live there, though.

And everyone else, kept out of these paradise zones, forced to struggle against an increasingly hostile environment? They are angry.

Billionaires start a reality show where lucky outsiders compete for limited spots in their new paradises. The huge underclass fights over these reality show spots, or the few decent jobs, like being a pregnancy surrogate (or an organ host â€“ part of a concentrated organ harvesting operation (COHO)) for billionaires.
