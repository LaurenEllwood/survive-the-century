## Pay for transition


The world agrees to the fastest possible transition to a zero-emissions world, even though this will require some changes to people’s lifestyles in rich countries. Cars, meat and fashion soon become luxury items.

A lot of people grumble about the lack of alternatives: a lot of things people need have been taken away, with nothing offered in their place.

We’re going to need massive investment into public transport (even in smaller cities), high-quality, affordable protein alternatives, and new ways for people to heat or cool their buildings. Hundreds of thousands of homes will need to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch to be more energy efficient.

All of this is going to cost a LOT of money.

**How should we pay for it?**

[[Reform capitalism. The super-rich should pay for everything, and the new infrastructure should belong to everyone.->Reform capitalism]]

[[Nationalize the biggest polluters.->Transitional fracking]]

[[Offer tax breaks and grants to tech companies who are working on solutions.->Green is the new gold]]
