Cars, meat and fashion soon become luxury items.

A lot of people grumble about the lack of alternatives: a lot of things people need have been taken away, with nothing offered in their place.

We’re going to need massive investment into public transport (even in smaller cities), high-quality, affordable protein alternatives, and new ways for people to heat or cool their buildings. Hundreds of thousands of homes will need to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch to be more energy efficient.

All of this is going to cost a LOT of money.

How should we pay for it?
