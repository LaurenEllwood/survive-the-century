The world agrees to the fastest-possible transition to a zero-emissions world, even though this will require some changes to people’s lifestyles in rich countries.
{:.leader-sentence}

A lot of people grumble about the lack of alternatives: a lot of things people in rich countries love have been taken away, with nothing offered in their place. Cars, meat and fast fashion soon become luxury items.

We’re going to need even more investment into public transport (even in smaller cities), high-quality, affordable protein alternatives, and new ways for people to heat or cool their buildings. Millions of homes will need to be renovated to be more energy efficient, and cities will need to build more renewable energy systems to power everything.

All of this is going to cost a LOT of money.

How should we pay for it?
