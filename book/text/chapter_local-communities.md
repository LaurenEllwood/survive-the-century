## Local communities

The world launches a global climate fund: a taxation pool that taxes those who produce pollution or consume luxury goods, and uses this money to fund indigenous communities and co-operatives around the world who act as stewards of the environment, which act as carbon sinks.

Global South countries band together and argue that they shouldnâ€™t have to contribute to this pool, and also that old IMF loans should be forgiven, because of the historical debt of colonialism.

**Should rich countries agree to this?**

[[That seems fair.->Global climate fund]]

[[Absolutely not!->Later Global South strike]]
