Energy companies blame the aggressive climate emission laws for high levels of unemployment. 
{:.leader-sentence}

They say that they can create a lot of new jobs in fracking, and that can be a transitional energy source while we move off coal. They can even re-invest those profits into carbon capture technology! A little more pollution now, but it will give us much more money to spend fixing the problem in future.

Should we approve new large-scale fracking projects?
