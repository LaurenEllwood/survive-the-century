## Transitional fracking

Energy companies blame the aggressive climate emission laws for high levels of unemployment. They say that they can create a lot of new jobs in fracking, and that can be a transitional energy source while we move off coal. They can even re-invest those profits into carbon capture technology! A little more pollution now, but it will give us much more money to spend fixing the problem in future.

**Should we approve new large-scale fracking projects?**
{:.choice-question}

[[No. We can’t afford to pollute the air even more.->Weak reforms]]

[[Yes, but only if the energy companies invest some of their profits in capturing the pollution that’s created.->Green is the new gold]]

[[Yes, but let’s nationalize this and use the profits to fund a universal basic income.->People get richer]]


Carbon capture technologies aim to clean the air by filtering pollution out and storing it, usually underground.
