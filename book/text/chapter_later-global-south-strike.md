Rich countries refuse!
{:.leader-sentence}

The Global South enters a strike. Those countries stay united and cut off natural resources. They refuse to export food, minerals or metals until the rich world agrees to their demands.

This hits the rich world where it hurts. Their manufacturing industries canâ€™t produce much, so the new iPhone launch is delayed. Worse, no one can get their hands on a decent cup of coffee.
