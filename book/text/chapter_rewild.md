## Rewild

We choose to rewild as much of the world as we can. Huge areas of land are now protected natural spaces given back to indigenous communities to steward, or managed by non-profit organizations.

Restoring so much land to its natural state allows for many formerly threatened species to start thriving again. Natural forests clean the air and help to trap greenhouse gases, speeding up our efforts to curb climate change.
