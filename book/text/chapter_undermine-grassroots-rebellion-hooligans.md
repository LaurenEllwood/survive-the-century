## Undermine grassroots rebellion (hooligans)


Your news site writes off the movement as being just a bunch of kids getting themselves tied up in knots over nothing, encouraged by vandals and hooligans who just want an excuse to loot stores.

After months of regular protests, when there is still no response from leaders, the activists eventually give up and the protests die down.
