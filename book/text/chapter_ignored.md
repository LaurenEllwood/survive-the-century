## Ignored


For most of the century, news organizations like yours have been the voice of moderate centrism, cautioning people against bold action.

Your readers have started to feel like that attitude is part of the reason the world is so difficult now. Readers have even had the audacity to write in and say that you are part of the problem!

Weirdly, you are becoming much less influential than you used to be.
