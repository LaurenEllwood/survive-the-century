## Weak reforms


We keep trying to reduce pollution through small, incremental changes. We slightly increase taxes on greenhouse gas emissions, but there are a lot of loopholes in these laws, and businesses generally find ways to get around changing.

We are polluting less than we were in the 2020s, but we’re far off the goals scientists told us we needed to reach to prevent catastrophic climate change.

Hopefully that won’t be a problem or anything.
