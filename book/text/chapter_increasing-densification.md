## Increasing densification

Cities welcome new migrants and invest in public housing, built with green technologies and incorporating a lot of urban gardens and social spaces.

Cities become denser, more multicultural. This leads to a new reckoning in what we value, and a greater awareness of our responsibilities to each other.

More people want to live in these cities, where the quality of life is better. Food production is increasingly densified, leaving more rural land available for use.

**What should we do with all of this former agricultural land?**
