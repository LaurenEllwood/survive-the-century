## Martians return


Uh oh. Remember all the billionaires who left in the 2060s and went to live on a Mars colony?

They just invaded Earth. They say they want their planet back.

**Oh boy. Do we still have some kind of global military we could call up?**

 { (if: $military is “no”)[[[Shoot! No, we disbanded all of the militaries, remember!?->Billionaire ecotopia takeover]]] (else:)[ [[Yes! We kept some militaries in place, so we can fight them off. Phew.->Welcome to 2090 (Ecotopia)]]] }
