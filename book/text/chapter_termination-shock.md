## Termination shock

{ (if: $termination is “roguestates”)[Yeah… that doesn’t work. The rogue states successfully hack the space mirrors and bring down the whole system.] (if: $termination is “mars”)[The Mars colony is going to cost an eye-melting amount of money. Most geo-engineering projects are defunded, and many of them have to be stopped suddenly.] }

It turns out that we’d become more dependent on geo-engineering than we realized. As soon as we stop, the temperature shoots up very suddenly.

[[This is BAD.->Zoonotic pandemic]]


One of the potential risks of blocking the sun’s rays is that if we stopped, the temperature could rise very suddenly. If the earth’s temperature changes too quickly, species aren’t able to adapt in time to the new conditions, and many might die. Scientists aren’t sure yet how big the risks of this sort of “termination shock” are.
