## Lena Lenin


### Trust is stronger than blood: An interview with Babylondon mayor Lena Lenin

By Sophia Al-Maria

*Lena Lenin talks Marie Antoinette, the myth of the nuclear family and the power of exotic stimulants.*

When Lena Lenin was in Year 5 at primary school in what was then Elephant and Castle, south London, a New Eden officer gave a talk to their class. She told the students that they had the potential to do great things in spite of the planetary hardship their generation would endure. They only had to work hard and dream big. Thirty years later and Lenin has done both of those things. The New Eden project that originated with her team when she was a young councillor in the borough that would become “the bubble” we see thriving today as it welcomes migrants and others displaced by climate disasters. And while the dome is being built to rival all previous civil engineering projects in the world, Lena Lenin is still dreaming of what might be possible for the people of this old town and also what could be possible for those who decide to ignore government guidance and stay outside the biospheres being built around the globe today.

Born in a council estate, Lena Lenin was raised by a queer co-op that shared a floor inside the Skyton Terrace Estate, a sprawling warren of public housing completed in the 1970s at the height of what would later be known as the 20th century’s greatest folly: relying on middle-aged white men to predict and build the future. These “chambers of despair”, as Skyton was once described by a former MP from the area, are what prodded Lenin to seek change, heading up solar panelling for the council at an early age and pushing through legislation to allow her friends and neighbours (all of whom she counts as family) more agency and autonomy from the city government and the metro police, both of whom seemed both historically and in the early half of the century to actively want the inhabitants not only disenfranchised but in many cases dead.

But how things have changed. Now in the year 2040, Lenin is the mayor of a world-building project the likes of which few civilizations have ever known. And hers is a vision of universal basic income, of radically non-judgemental policies regarding everything from gender and sexuality and sexual health to drug use as well as spirituality and all of this funded by the new release of petro-dollars from the UK’s allies in Nigeria and Colombia and the Gulf Oil states.

We sat to have a chat with Lenin over her favourite new designer drug, a Guatamalan bird-picked snuff Membre power, and strawberry macaroons from one of the few antique heritage suppliers that will be continuing to work within the new Babylondon economic bubble zone (BEBZ): La Duree.

*You’ve been keen to include certain “heritage” companies in the transition period. These macaroons are delicious, but why French pastry when it has been such a symbol for your detractors who say you have a latter-day Marie Antoinette attitude in spite of your humble beginnings?*

“Let they/them eat cake” was an early jab my enemies liked to throw at me. And so I decided I wanted to just own it. The ideals of the French Revolution haven’t died in the 21st century. We believe in many of the Jacobin ideals for ‘the people’; we could just do without the terror. The brutality and ugliness and puritanism of its methods have left their warning. I want there to be joy and beauty in the future. I believe there will be both. And sometimes it’s the little things. Like a small sweet pastry that makes a big difference in morale. So yes, I thought it would be good to have a bit of old-world refinement alongside the new-world tech and sweeping legal and social changes we are implementing. No police and everyone gets a couture stipend and as much free time as they like to pursue their interests and joys as long as it doesn’t impinge or infringe on anyone else’s. With that in mind, we chose a few special products and companies to represent the old world. Think of BEBZ on closure in thirty years time as having been a sort of curated corporate ark if you will. We’re keeping Burberry but getting rid of Bentley, for example. No need for us to be driving long distance inside the BEBZ and let’s use those petrochemicals for other purposes like keeping our servers chilled. Amiright?

*You grew up in a co-op. Many people mourn the loss of nuclear families. Do you think your background means you have less empathy for those who miss the old blood way of kin-making?*

For me trust is stronger than blood. Any day. If I don’t trust you, I won’t turn to you in a crisis. If we share the same bloodfather, there is no reason I should turn to you for help. The kin I choose and that any one of us chooses on this planet are our true love and saviours. And that rarely comes in a heteronormative package. This is why my campaigning and life’s work has been to normalise what used to be considered deviant. That includes everything from identifying as asexual to having access to assisted suicide. I run on a radically non-judgemental platform. You can do what you want as long as you don’t infringe on anyone else’s ability to do what they want. It’s simple. It’s natural. It’s really really real.

*Hardline anti-BEBZ campaigners have latched onto your open and public drug use and pro-synth policies in the face of GMO scandals as a sign you are not in a fit state of mind to lead. What do you have to say in response to that?*

Do you recall when we used to call them Chads? There will always be a threat that these nutjobs will resurface but for the most part they exist in the outer limits of chat rooms and live outside the bubbles. We have anti-xenophobic failsafes in place for future dreamers who want to join us, however there will always be a bad apple in a basket of home-grown fruit and that’s why we retain one ugly element of the old world: the death penalty.

*I’m sorry but some might say you’re dodging the question about drug use, Mayor Lenin.*

On the contrary. If in the old days, they were comfortable being led by the sober and senile rather than the compus mentus and high, then I ask you to consider simply where that led us. We’ve got to try something new. And if de-moralizing the social order and taking the stigma out of the things traditionally and wrongly believed to be “bad” doesn’t lead to an immediate and radical change for the “good” then I don’t know what will.

That is all.

## Reddit thread: Globohomo vaccine whistle blown

Online Culture reporter Sophia Al-Maria brings us a sampling of what’s happening on your favourite social networks.

*Re-posted from r/conspiracy*

Posted by u/[curveddelirium] 1 hour ago

\*\*GLOBOHOMO VACCINE WHISTLE BLOWN!\*\*

FOR ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH

YOU NEED TO READ THIS

Liberals have been trying to push their agendas like LGBTQ ‘rights’ etc. down our throats via the liberal fake news media. Forced diversity and Covid are the \#1 news stories. I have NEVER worn a mask and I am 100 per cent healthy and heterosexual.

Given how feminism has demonised males and masculinity and tried to make all men into beta cucks. Now they want to literally VASECTOMIZE and HYSTERECTOMIZE heterosexuals covertly via the vaccine so they can reduce the population size and make it easy to govern us under one unified government aka the NEW WORLD ORDER.

The population is WEAK and DISTRACTED

Now as to the vaccine…think about it. It’s the perfect delivery service. It will be rolled out to BILLIONS of people GLOBALLY. The media industrial complex has filled everyone with fear that if you walk outside without a mask you’re going to kill 100 grannies. This is going to be ENFORCED under the guise of ‘protecting the world from deadly Coronavirus’ when in reality the deep state wants to kill two birds with one stone. The vaccine will cause all who take it to have a SERIOUS and IRREVERSIBLE aversion to heterosexual lifestyles to STOP BREEDING and CONTROL the population.

I have seen some theories floating around on here that the ‘virus’ was lab designed and strategically released. Even if that were true you would have to be dumb to ignore the fact that it came from China AKA the same country that imposed a one child policy on their citizens to CURB POPULATION GROWTH. Coincidence? Of course NOT!

They are trying to STERILIZE US!!!

WAKE UP!!!

## Paris Fashion Week 2060 special report 

By Sophia Al-Maria

It’s been a devastating few decades for the fashion industry as it transitions away from the traditional “seasons” of S/S and F/W to favour a timeless Resort format more befitting the sunny new outlook of the 2060s. With the newly launched space mirrors climate-controlling our lives to the minutest degree, we are seeing more and more reflective inspirations from bias-cut rescue-blanket gowns and party attire to disco ball inspired legwarmers and McQueen-esque armadillo heels that pay homage to the mirrors dreamed up and launched from Shanghai’s labs last year.

In the collections? A kaleidoscopic medley, iridescent PU fabrics and an attention to the unseen spectrums of ultraviolet and infrared. It’s an odd mash-up in terms of garments, with light basic T-shirts and trousers trimmed with synthetic furs (microscopic metal fibres that read to the eye as a grey fur) – furkinis, for example. In other words, it’s glamour, a return to the skimp and flair of some 70 years ago. Iridium-infused polymers create trippy subtleties, and leave the texture of clothing distinctly metallic.

We never thought we’d see the sun set on overengineered doomer fashions of the thirties, the apocalypse we anticipated was actually a psychic fatigue of it. To some, though, the glamour we have now isn’t one of choice, so much as luxury’s assault – unceasing and perfectly acclimatised to our consumption before we ever know it. The more avant garde designers are trying to break out quite literally from the civil enclaves of perpetual resort and pamper. Silhouettes mock the glamorous revivalism found today, with floor-length dresses designed to trail and soil at the hem, exposing the steel-wool-ish makeup that most textiles have nowadays. It’s rebellious, a little Romantic, and a bit dirty. People have called it juvenile and fantastic in equal measure. Other designers have taken their fabric shears to entire cultures – a designer’s final look proposes a hijab-cum-qipao halterback, of course debuting to mixed applause.

China’s hold on luxury is still unmatched. Some insiders noted the lineage from the highly engineered styles that came maybe only a decade or so before; fabrics like synthetic calluses that came to define the era. Tongue-in-cheek screenprinted silicon shirts, suits and little black dresses leaned into the trompe l'oeil and contemporary fascination of daily life’s make-up not being what it seems; the 16k screen prints sat atop opaque and warm-to--the-touch synthetic vegan leathers that are still ever so popular.

Even further, outerwear (that is, to the extent to which a garment can be said to be definitively “outer” anymore) tends to be imbued with any properties a person might need, as points of difference – that of probiotic goodness, energy, analytics and drug administration. However, woven fabrics are not exactly extinct; cut any of these membranous materials open (if you can) and you will be met with an explosive tuft of fibres. They’re the foundational base patterns by which all clothes are still made, giving all necessary ranges of movement and near impenetrable durability. We have the aeronautic and defence sector to thank for this one, with our current landscape of fibre-reinforced PU latexes, silicons and leathers being the new petro-infused norm.

Even with all of this defiant chemical romance to the garments, there’s an odd but not at all unexpected return to nature, a rewilding of our minds and art – one of the few places this exists. For example, skirt silhouettes are cloven, with the midi and mini variations giving way to the “chidi”, or orchid-like imbricate forms of petals: hemlines often appear both high and low simultaneously, depending on who you ask – think McQueen bumsters or Deroyli hot sqorts.

With that said, some of the most expensive garments out there are single-use, degrading over the course of a day (32 hours is the current record) – we have Korean designers and K-Beauty brands operating from Rwanda to thank for this. It’s all in stark opposition to fast fashion that is made more-or-less on demand and from scratch, though takes an epoch to decompose naturally. Turnover is high, but this, today, is offset by apps that make the redistribution of these clothes as seamless and as easy as anything. Clothing is both re-gifted and repurposed into heat blankets, shelter and rafts. These humanitarian aid and crisis start-ups have kickstarted what’s known as the donation economy, giving the fashion industry and its consumers a smug sense of purpose. In many ways it’s because high fashion exists between the permanent and temporary, amid a ballooning middle class. Everything is dropped in fortnightly slots of edits, rather than “collections”. New studies into the importance of news cycles’ effects on human psychology reveal that news is a kind of food for our anthropocentric social disposition. Withdrawal from people and news is understood to be fatal in many cases – all press really is good press when it comes to staying alive.

There are, still, overarching trends that stick within these brief windows. Body modifications have made faces and other aspects of human presentation identikit among the mainstream – the generalised feline features once attributed to camera iPhone apps like the “aesthetic analytics” giant Facetune have actually been grafted onto people's faces – one needn't honour their genetics seeing as it's so cheap and accessible. There are trends tending towards subdermal implants (both tech-based or aesthetic) and scarification of flowers, animals and corporate brand logos taking the place that tattooing once had. More rebellious youths are opting for eye tattoo, fangs and nail-bed implants which have become perhaps the breakthrough beauty innovation of our time; perma-nails have become the new luxury accessory and jewellery item to have. Made in any material from ceramic to titanium, with cheaper variants made with highly durable polys. The biggest brands market them like fine jewellery for women and top-end watches for men, but have found more practical everyday use in the place that wallets and purses once held.

It must be said, it feels like we’re at the technological bleeding edge, with much excitement to be expected with what we wear in the coming year – it’s all about leaning into the reflection of ourselves, not away from it.
