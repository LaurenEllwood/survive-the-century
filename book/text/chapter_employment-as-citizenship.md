## Employment as citizenship

A lot of the migrants are offered “corporate citizenship” – business visas that mean getting a job with one of the big multinationals is the only way they’re allowed to live in one of the parts of the world that are still easy to live in. Losing their job means exile.

And exile is a problem, because [[large parts of the world are becoming unliveable.->Orange zones]]


As climate impacts worsen, many people will be displaced from their homes. Adapting to climate change in a just and equitable way will require us to rethink how we accommodate refugees, creating new policies that guarantee their rights to seek asylum and safety. Climate justice is migrant justice.
