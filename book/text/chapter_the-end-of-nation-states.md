## The end of nation states


Nation states do less and less â€“ theyâ€™re just an administrative hassle and a barrier to truly fair global decision-making.

We finally abolish nation states and replace them with a network of local democracies, with fair representation from every community in the world on a central world council. Citizens are very active within the politics of their own cities or small communities.
