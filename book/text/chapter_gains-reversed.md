## Gains reversed


Over the next few years, the world elects a number of Margaret Thatcher/Ronald Reagan-type pro-capitalist national leaders. They argue that weâ€™ve ruined the economy by trying to control it, and we need to let the free market do its job.

They loosen regulations, including environmental laws, which leads to a massive increase in emissions again.

Oh, and all of the new public housing, public transport, schools and hospitals we built in the 2020s? We sell them off to private businesses.

[[Well, you made it through the decade!->Welcome to 2040 (Slow Fade)]]
