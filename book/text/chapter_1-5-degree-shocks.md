The world is now capturing more greenhouse gases than it produces, but we’re still recovering from damage that was done to the environment earlier in the century.

In 2062, we get unlucky. Hot oceans lead to a series of terrible hurricanes across the southern US and Caribbean, destroying thousands of homes and ripping up forests.

We’re already capturing a lot of greenhouse gases through natural methods like planting trees and preserving wild areas, but some groups say we need to speed things up with high-tech carbon capture technology.

What do you think we should do?

> If we were to cut all greenhouse gas emissions today, temperatures would probably stabilize within the next 10 to 30 years. But this would not stop climate change: stopping temperature rise would not stop ice melting and sea levels rising. We have caused irreparable damage to our climate, in which our past and present greenhouse gas emissions have “locked-in changes” regardless of what emissions cut we make moving forward. That doesn’t mean our actions don’t matter: every 0.1 of a degree of extra warming translates into more lives lost and more species extinct.
