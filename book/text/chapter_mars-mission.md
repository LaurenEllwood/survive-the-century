## Mars mission?

We start experiencing even more climate shocks: hurricanes, fires, droughts, flooding, animal and insect death. They’re coming fast now.

There’s a growing movement that calls themselves “Planet B”. They argue that geo-engineering the earth is a waste of time. We should rather put all of our resources into colonizing Mars on a larger scale.
