# How to play

Three quick things you need to know before we get started:

1. At the beginning of each new decade, you’ll get a glimpse of what the headlines look like because of the decisions you’ve made.

[If you’d rather just read those stories, turn to page](stories.html){:.show-page-number.no-brackets}.
