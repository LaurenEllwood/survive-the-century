An unlikely alliance of Saudi billionaires who miss being able to go outside without dying, disgruntled former SpaceX engineers, and K-Pop stars looking to leave a legacy surprise the world by launching a fleet of space mirrors to reflect sunlight away from the planet.

A K-Pop supergroup promotes the project by releasing a song called “Space Space Planet Baby” that tops the charts in every country.

The project is successful beyond anyone’s expectations. And because the K-Pop stars promote the project, no one can be too mad about it.

The group puts a global council in place with representatives from all around the world, who will be responsible for managing the space fleet. All representatives must be under the age of 20, because they have the most stake in the future of the planet.
