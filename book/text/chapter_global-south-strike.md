## Global South strike


The Global South enters a strike. Those countries stay united and cut off natural resources. They refuse to export food, minerals or metals until the rich world stops polluting and agrees to contribute to a global environmental repair fund.

This hits the rich world where it hurts. The manufacturing industries can’t produce much. The new iPhone launch is delayed. Worse, no one in the rich world can get their hands on a decent cup of coffee.
