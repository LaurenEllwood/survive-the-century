## Sudden warming

The effects are terrible: mass extinctions, devastated crops. The biggest impacts are in the oceans – in the first year, fish stocks halve. Then they halve again.

The eastern allies led by the United States finally surrender. The war is over.

Millions starve. Billions are displaced. This decade is called “the terrible 70s”.
