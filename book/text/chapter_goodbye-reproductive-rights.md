## Goodbye reproductive rights

Populist leaders emerge calling for us to restrict access to contraception and abortion. They gain some momentum by appealing to regressive groups who feel like the world has changed too much, too quickly, and win some political power.

But after decades of greater empowerment, women around the world stand together and refuse to accept this.

The movement fizzles out.
