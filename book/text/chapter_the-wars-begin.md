## The wars begin

America’s rogue geo-engineering is the last straw. This sparks a decade-long world war.

There are geo-engineering and counter geo-engineering attacks on both sides, and vicious proxy wars all around the world. Millions of people die, and the world’s economy is devastated.

After nine years, there’s still no clear winner. People are exhausted of fighting. The leaders of both sides agree to a clandestine meeting.

**What do you think, editor? Should they agree to a truce?**
