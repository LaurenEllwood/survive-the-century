Climate rebels around the world start implementing small-scale projects to hack the climate. 
{:.leader-sentence}

These projects somewhat work, but have unintended consequences. Communities have to adapt to a lot of sudden weather changes: areas that had a lot of rainfall suddenly have to cope with droughts; cities that had become more resilient against droughts suddenly have to deal with flooding.

Overall, the temperature of the planet doesn’t increase as much as it might have, but the disruption to people’s lives is arguably higher.
