## Sexual revolution


Universal basic income allows many more women to enter politics. Over the next few years, these progressive leaders pass a number of democratic reforms to make sure that wealth is more fairly distributed.

Overall, people are much richer and better educated.

Climate change is just a technological problem. We’ll deal with it later.

What else do people do with their newfound spare time? Well…

There’s a new sexual revolution. Birth rates continue to fall, marriage rates plummet, 60 per cent of women and 45 per cent of men now identify as queer.

**What do you think, bigshot editor? Are you okay with this?**
