## Monocorp cities

After decades of defunding, democracies have no ability to govern anymore. Capitalists aren’t perfect but we trust them more than big government. We decide that private companies should keep running these projects.

Runaway effects of the climate hacks devastate parts of the world, forcing the last remaining free societies into corporate cities, where they hope to “earn” citizenship through work… maybe. One day. The unluckiest are forced into jobs on the nascent Mars colony.
