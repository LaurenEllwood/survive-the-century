The effects of climate change are getting more and more severe. 
{:.leader-sentence}

Some experts argue that it’s time to deploy some form of ambitious geoengineering project to buy ourselves time to get the climate back under control.

But geoengineering technology is still largely untested, and there’s a lot of uncertainty about whether it will work, or how it would be managed. Something could go wrong.

We could try geoengineering now, or spend a few more years talking about it first, trying to reach international consensus about how we should go about it.

Should we try a last-ditch geoengineering solution?

> Solar radiation management or modification (SRM) is an untested group of techniques and technologies that aim to reflect sunlight away from the earth. These include ideas like injecting sulphur aerosols into the stratosphere, brightening the clouds above the ocean, or even deploying space mirrors that bounce sunlight away from the earth. SRM would not undo the damage we’ve done to our planet: instead, it would simply slow warming without reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change. SRM is highly controversial, with many people arguing that further tampering with our climate system is too risky.
