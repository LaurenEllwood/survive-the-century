## Faffing


Rich countries threaten to drop out of the summit completely if pushed too hard, arguing that they’re still recovering from the post-Covid economic crash. We decide it’s more important to keep everyone in the process than to pass aggressive targets now. We decide to pass laughably small targets that we aim to increase in future.

[[Well, you made it through the decade!->Welcome to 2040 (Slow Fade)]]
