## Global South uprising + slow fade

The world is falling far short of the (pitiful) climate change targets agreed to, and the worst impacts are happening in poor countries.

The leaders of 50 countries in the Global South (low-income countries) band together and say *enough. This is our last shot. We have to stop all emissions within the next 15 years, and urgently try to reverse the damage that’s already been done.*

**Most of your readers live in rich countries. Will you encourage them to take responsibility and get serious about reversing the damage we’ve done to the planet?**
{:.choice-question}

[[Absolutely. The rich world should accept full responsibility and pay for the damage that’s been done.->Late-stage designer planet]]

[[The rich world should absolutely stop polluting, but every country needs to find its own solutions.->Patchwork of solutions]]

[[Rude! Those Global South upstarts need to be put in their place.->Welcome to 2050 (Climate Wars)]]

[[Surely some cheap magical technology could just fix this?->Lucky procrastinator]]
