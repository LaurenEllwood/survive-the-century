# Privacy Policy

Last updated: April 19, 2021

We are committed to offering you a service that respects your privacy. Wherever possible, we avoid collecting any data that is not critical for us to provide you with our service.

If you have any questions about any of our terms, please pop us an email and we’ll try to help: [sam.beckbessinger@gmail.com](mailto:sam.beckbessinger@gmail.com){:.copy-to-clipboard}

## We don’t collect personal information

We do not collect any personally identifiable information.

## Non-identifiable information

We do collect non-identifiable, aggregated information that helps us to understand our users better, such as which city they are from and what model of device they have.

We do log anonymous usage statistics and collect data about the decisions individual players make when playing the game. Such data is never connected to any information that could be used to identify you.

We reserve the right to publish such non-identifiable, aggregated information, for instance, in articles discussing the most common choices players make. We reserve the right for such anonymized information to be used in academic research projects, publications or other purposes that support the project's goals.

## Third-party services

We rely on third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Here are links to the privacy policies of those third-party service providers:

## Third-party services may use cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

We do not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, we may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve our services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this service.

## We are not responsible for your security on external sites

This service does contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us.
